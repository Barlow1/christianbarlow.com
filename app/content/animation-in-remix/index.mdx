Welcome to my blog! I wanted a place to share new things I'm learning with the react community.
I've already learned so much about Remix Run and SSR (Server Side Rendering) just by creating this simple blog site.
My favorite thing about remix is definitely the speed. âš¡
I could talk all day about this framework and I'm so excited to share all of this content, but for now... Let's make a cool countdown animation component so we can launch
this blog the right way! I am using react-spring for simplifying the transform animations. 

Here is the example:

import Demo from "./Demo.tsx";

<Demo />

Install react-spring:

```
npm add @react-spring/web
```

Save the rocket from [here](/rocket.png) and paste it into your public folder. (mine is app/public in remix)

<div>Icons made by <a href="https://www.freepik.com" title="Freepik">Freepik</a> from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/" title="Flaticon">www.flaticon.com</a></div>

Add the rocket png to the links export in your route file 

```tsx filename=app/posts/$slug.tsx
export let links: LinksFunction = () => {
  return [
    {
      rel: "image",
      href: "/rocket.png",
    },
  ];
};
```
We need to establish some state for our countdown. "show" will add/remove our animated count down component.
"selected" will store the state of the countdown index. "items" holds our countdown display values. Then, we'll create a
useEffect that triggers to increment the selected index every 1 second and will hide the component when the index is greater
than 5.

``` tsx filename=app/components/CountDown.tsx
  const [show, setShow] = useState(true);
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState(0);
  const items = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0];


  useEffect(() => {
    if (selected < 5) {
      setTimeout(() => {
        setSelected(selected + 1);
      }, 1000);
    } else {
      setShow(false);
    }
  }, [selected]);
```

Next, we'll need to create our countdown transition using the useTransition hook. The opacity field will cause
the countdown to fade in & out. The transform property will translate the count 50px on enter/leave.

```tsx filename=app/components/CountDown.tsx
  /**
   * this hook is for your countdown transitions
   *  it will fade in and out & handle the countdown
   **/
  
  const transition = useTransition(show, {
    from: {
      display: "inline-block",
      opacity: 1,
      transform: "translate3d(0,-50px,0)",
    },
    enter: { opacity: 1, transform: "translate3d(0,0px,0)"},
    leave: { opacity: 0, transform: "translate3d(0,-50px,0)" },
    color: "white",
    config: config.molasses,
  });
```

Add your rocket ship transition. Note that we add a 5 second delay
so the rocket ship doesn't blast off too early.

```tsx filename=app/components/CountDown.tsx
/**
   * this hook is for your rocket transitions
   *  it will fade in and translate up
   **/
  const rocketTransition = useTransition(true, {
    from: {
      opacity: 0,
      transform: "translate3d(0,100px,0)",
      display: "inline-block",
    },
    enter: { opacity: 1, transform: "translate3d(0,10px,0)" },
    leave: { opacity: 0, transform: "translate3d(0,100px,0)" },
    config: config.molasses,
    // 5 second delay
    delay: 5000,
  });
```

Slap that baby in a few animated divs and return it! (Make sure to import animated from "@react-spring/web")
If you experience any snappy motions in react-spring, adding position: "absolute" to the animated.div is usually
the fix.

```tsx filename=app/components/CountDown.tsx
  return (
    <div className="flex-col">
      {transition(
        ({ opacity, transform }, item) =>
          item && (
            <animated.div
              className="pl-5"
              style={{
                color: "white",
                fontSize: "50px",
                opacity: opacity,
                transform: transform,
                // this will reduce any snappy animations
                position: "absolute",
              }}
              key={"countdown1"}
            >
              {items[selected]}
            </animated.div>
          )
      )}
      {rocketTransition(({ opacity, transform }) => (
        <animated.div
          style={{
            opacity: opacity,
            transform: transform,
          }}
        >
          <h3 className="inline">Blast off!</h3>
          <img
            aria-label="rocket"
            src="/rocket.png"
            className="w-10 h-10 md:w-14 md:h-14"
          ></img>
        </animated.div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
```

Here is the full code for the component:

```tsx filename=app/components/CountDown.tsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useTransition, config } from "@react-spring/core";
import { animated } from "@react-spring/web";

function Demo() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(true);
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState(0);
  const items = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0];


  useEffect(() => {
    if (selected < 5) {
      setTimeout(() => {
        setSelected(selected + 1);
      }, 1000);
    } else {
      setShow(false);
    }
  }, [selected]);


  const transition = useTransition(show, {
    from: {
      display: "inline-block",
      opacity: 1,
      transform: "translate3d(0,-50px,0)",
    },
    enter: { opacity: 1, transform: "translate3d(0,0px,0)" },
    leave: { opacity: 0, transform: "translate3d(0,-50px,0)"},
    color: "white",
    config: config.molasses,
  });

  const rocketTransition = useTransition(true, {
    from: {
      opacity: 0,
      transform: "translate3d(0,100px,0)",
      display: "inline-block",
    },
    enter: { opacity: 1, transform: "translate3d(0,10px,0)"  },
    leave: { opacity: 0, transform: "translate3d(0,100px,0)"  },
    config: config.molasses,
    delay: 5000,
  });

  return (
    <div className="flex-col">
      {transition(
        ({ opacity, transform }, item) =>
          item && (
            <animated.div
              className="pl-5"
              style={{
                color: "white",
                fontSize: "50px",
                opacity: opacity,
                transform: transform,
                // this will reduce any snappy animations
                position: "absolute",
              }}
              key={"countdown1"}
            >
              {items[selected]}
            </animated.div>
          )
      )}
      {rocketTransition(({ opacity, transform }) => (
        <animated.div
          style={{
            opacity: opacity,
            transform: transform,
          }}
        >
          <h3 className="inline">Blast off!</h3>
          <img
            aria-label="rocket"
            src="/rocket.png"
            className="w-10 h-10 md:w-14 md:h-14"
          ></img>
        </animated.div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
export default Demo;
```

Does this look familiar? That's because animations are friendly with remix and SSR and it's just like working on the client.
Although route transitions can be tricky, optomistic UI becomes so much easier with form transiton states from remix.
Be sure to checkout my seperate post about that. Thanks for reading!
