# Animation in Remix Run (SSR)

Welcome to my blog! I wanted a place to share new things I'm learning with the react community.
I've already learned so much about Remix Run and SSR (Server Side Rendering) just by creating this simple blog site.
My favorite thing about remix is definitely the speed. âš¡
I could talk all day about remix and I'm so excited to share all of this content, but for now... Let's make a cool countdown animation component so we can launch
this blog the right way! I am using @react-spring/web for simplifying the transform animations. 

Here is the example:

import Demo from "./Demo.tsx";

<Demo />

Install react-spring:

```
npm add @react-spring/web
```

Save the rocket from [here](/startup.png) and paste it into your public folder. (mine is app/public in remix)

Add the import to the links export in your route file 

```tsx filename=app/root.tsx
export let links: LinksFunction = () => {
  return [
    {
      rel: "image",
      href: "/startup.png",
    },
  ];
};
```

Here is the full code for the component:

```tsx filename=app/components/CountDown.tsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useTransition, config } from "@react-spring/core";
import { animated } from "@react-spring/web";

function Demo() {
  // just creating an array that counts down from 5 to 1
  const NUM_TRANS = 
  [...Array(6).keys()].reverse().slice(0, -1);
  const [items, setItems] = useState(NUM_TRANS);

  /**
   * this hook is for your countdown transitions
   *  it will fade in and translate down
   **/
  const transitions = useTransition(items, {
    from: {
        // fade
      opacity: 0,
      // translate
      transform: "translate3d(0,-40px,0)",
      display: "inline-block",
    },
    enter: { opacity: 1, transform: "translate3d(0,0px,0)" },
    leave: { opacity: 0, transform: "translate3d(0,-40px,0)" },
    trail: items.length ? 1000 : 0,
    config: config.molasses,
  });
/**
   * this hook is for your rocket transitions
   *  it will fade in and translate up
   **/
  const rocketTransition = useTransition(true, {
    from: {
      opacity: 0,
      transform: "translate3d(0,100px,0)",
      display: "inline-block",
    },
    enter: { opacity: 1, transform: "translate3d(0,10px,0)" },
    leave: { opacity: 0, transform: "translate3d(0,100px,0)" },
    config: config.molasses,
    delay: 5000,
  });

  return (
    <div className="flex">
      <div className="flex">
        {/** Countdown **/ 
        transitions(({ opacity, transform }, item) => (
          <animated.div
            style={{
              opacity: opacity,
              transform: transform,
            }}
          >
            <h1 className="px-5">{item}</h1>
          </animated.div>
        ))}
      </div>
      <div>
        {/** Rocket **/ 
        rocketTransition(({ opacity, transform }) => (
          <animated.div
            style={{
              opacity: opacity,
              transform: transform,
            }}
          >
            <h3 className="inline">Blast off!</h3>
            <img
              aria-label="rocket"
              src="/startup.png"
              className="w-10 h-10 md:w-14 md:h-14"
            ></img>
          </animated.div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
export default Demo;
```

Does this look familiar? That's because animations are friendly with remix and SSR and it's just like working on the client.
Besides route animations, they can be done, but it doesn't feel natural yet.
